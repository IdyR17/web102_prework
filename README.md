# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster Crowdfunding *

Submitted by: **Juri Rodriguez**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] A floating navigation bar was added to easily go back and forth between elements, it consists on three buttons: Home, Stats, Games.
* [x] A search bar was added to filter by game name. It has the ability to autopopulate by keystroke (I also added a "Find" button but that isn't necessary as filtered games dynamically change according to the query).

## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented features:

## Notes

The app's asthetics did not look exactly like the prework guide, but the specific styling was already in the project forked from codepath, so I commented it out in the css file. Learning about applying filters to objects and using reduce on objects to then bring them to the DOM was the most challenging and fun part. I particularly loved the usability of the arrow functions as I haven't used them as much before. I commend the codepath team for such a well-written, fun, engaging and easy to follow pre-work guide.
